<p>Death rates among heart surgery patients are falling despite surgeons taking on more high-risk cases, a report has said. </p>
<p>Doctors said quality of care has been improving since the first publication of mortality rates in cardiac surgery in 2001, despite fears surgeons would become risk averse.</p>
<p>People undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, which accounts for about 60 per cent of all heart surgery in adults, are less likely to die than before results were published.</p>
<p>John Black, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: “All branches of surgery are following the trail on reporting outcomes that cardiac surgeons have blazed and this should spur those efforts on.</p>
<p>“All of medicine should take note of the findings that full audit has not resulted in risk-averse behaviour.”</p>
<p>The report, from the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery, contains complete coverage of all NHS hospitals undertaking adult heart surgery in Britain.</p>
<p>It found that, in 2008, a quarter of all patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were over 75 – a rise of 10 per cent on the number in 1999.</p>
<p>The number of people over 80 having the surgery is also rising, making up 4.4 per cent of all patients undergoing this type of operation.</p>
<p>There are also more people with diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure having the operation, which all carry extra risks.</p>
<p>Despite these rises, the chance of a person dying has fallen from 2.6 per cent in 2001, to 1.9 per cent in 2004 to 1.5 per cent in 2008.</p>
<p>There has also been a marked fall in death rates among patients over the age of 75, from 5 per cent in 2004 to 3.4 per cent in 2008.</p>
<p>Ben Bridgewater, author of the report and a consultant cardiac surgeon at the University Hospital of South Manchester, said: “One of the benefits we are now seeing from public reporting of outcomes is not just about bringing poor performers ‘into the pack’ but improving the performance of the pack as a whole.</p>
<p>“The very act of auditing services brings about improvements as centres learn from one another.</p>

<li><p>Depression is Common<br>Some people report heightened emotions for up to a year after surgery, including a tendency to cry, reports WebMD. The Cleveland Clinic said it is common for patients to feel depressed after heart surgery, with about 20 percent of CABG patients experiencing major depression.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“In one landmark study, the continued presence of depression after recovery increased the risk of death (mortality) to 17 percent within six months after a heart attack (versus 3 percent mortality in heart attack patients who didn’t have depression),” reports The Cleveland Clinic.</p>
<p>Be aware of the possibility and communicate with healthcare providers because early detection can help tremendously. Depression also can significantly slow recovery and healing. </p>

</code></pre><p>EVERY year, about 10,000 people who had bypass surgery to correct clogged coronary arteries die of heart attacks. All too often, these heart attacks are mysteries.</p>
<p>“A lot of time, it is not completely understood why these people are having heart attacks,” said Dr. Timothy Fischell, a cardiologist at Stanford University Medical Center. “They should be better off rather than worse off.” In 70 percent of the cases, Dr. Fischell added, the vein or artery graft used to bypass the clogged blood vessel looks perfectly fine.</p>
<p>The problem also occurs in patients who have balloon angioplasty, in which an expandable device is used to open blocked vessels. Theory Is Proposed</p>
<p>Now Dr. Fischell and his colleagues have proposed an explanation for these mysterious heart attacks. Their theory has intrigued other cardiologists even as it has raised controversy.</p>
<p>They suggest that one cause of heart attacks after bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty is that the coronary arteries themselves are trying to recreate the sort of blood flow they were used to when the artery was clogged. Before the operation, only a trickle of blood got past the blockage, and so the blood pressure downstream from the occlusion was very low. Dr. Fischell and his colleagues believe that coronary arteries can clamp down after bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty to try to create the same sort of blood pressure just past the previously occluded areas.</p>
<p>The findings were published in a recent issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation.</p>
<p>“It’s fascinating and it makes physiologic sense,” said Dr. Henry Buchwald, a heart disease researcher and professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Researchers have known for years that arteries are far from being passive tubes like garden hoses. Instead, they are rimmed with muscle cells that can twitch, squeeze down and relax to make the arteries wider or narrower. Coronary arteries are known to sometimes go into spasms, which can starve the heart of blood and cause chest pains and even heart attacks. But cardiologists had not thought that previously blocked arteries might clamp down because they remembered their old blood flow situation and thought it normal.</p>
<p>Dr. Fischell first proposed the hypothesis two years ago when he examined a man who had a severe heart attack shortly after having had bypass surgery. The surgeons had bypassed two blocked arteries, one that was nearly completely clogged and the other that was about 50 percent constricted.</p>
<p>To find out what was going on, Dr. Fischell said he put a dye in the man’s arteries so he could observe them in X-rays. He saw that the artery that had once been almost completely blocked had squeezed itself down to prevent blood from getting past the site of the previous occlusion. Dr. Fischell opened up the artery by giving the man nitroglycerin, which forced the artery to unclench.</p>
<p>Now Dr. Fischell has garnered further evidence for his hypothesis by studying 20 people who were about to have balloon angioplasty, a procedure in which a small balloon is inflated in a clogged artery to squash the plaque down and open the blood vessel. The patients had varying degrees of blockage and Dr. Fischell and his colleagues predicted that the arteries that had been blocked the most would constrict the most after the procedure and those that had been blocked the least would constrict the least.</p>
<p>The researchers measured the blood pressure downstream from each patient’s blockage. Then they opened the arteries with angioplasty. They waited 30 minutes, then measured the blood pressure downstream again. The investigators found that the patients’ arteries did constrict and that the arteries that had been most occluded clamped down hardest, confirming their predictions.</p>
<p>None of these patients had constrictions severe enough to cause heart attacks, so doctors cannot say whether such constriction might be the cause of most heart attacks after bypass surgery or angioplasty.</p>
<p>Dr. Fischell believes they are and recommends that patients be given nitroglycerin for a few weeks after surgery to keep their arteries open while they relearn what is a normal blood pressure downstream. Some Are Skeptical</p>
<p>Others are not entirely convinced.</p>
<p>Dr. Jeffrey Isner, chief of cardiovascular research at Tufts University Medical School in Boston, said, “The quality of the clinical investigation is really outstanding,” but he said he and others were not sure that the sorts of spasms Dr. Fischell had documented were clinically significant.</p>
<p>But, Dr. Isner said, even if the observation does not explain all heart attacks after bypass surgery or angioplasty, it could still be crucially important to cardiologists once they understand the implications of what is happening. </p>

<li><p>Protein is a primary nutrient your body needs. Choose lean meats, skinless poultry, and eggs. Avoid fatty meats, such as prime cuts of steak, hot dogs or sausages, which contain excessive saturated fat. Dairy products are a good protein source, but choose low-fat or non-fat milk, cheese and yogurt, according to Medline Plus.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Oily fish contains heart-protecting omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel and lake trout have rich amounts of omega-3s. You also get a healthy dose of protein with fish. The American Heart Association encourages consumption of fish at least twice a week.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fruits and vegetables provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, as well as antioxidants to fight off disease-causing free radicals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Apples contain quercetin and reduce the risk of heart disease, strokes and blood clots when eaten regularly, according to an Iowa Women’s Health Study, reported in MindBodyGreen.</p>
<p>Leafy green vegetables such as kale and romaine lettuce provide folate that builds amino acids to protect the heart. Spinach provides both folate and magnesium. Magnesium promotes a healthy heartbeat and is used to treat the irregular beat of arrhythmia.<br>Latest News Update<br>Get Newsmax TV At Home »</p>
<p>Tomatoes are a great source of lycopene, which helps the body produce antioxidants that support heart health, according to MindBodyGreen.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whole grains are a good source of fiber and help to maintain healthy blood pressure. Always choose whole grains instead of refined or processed grains, which have been robbed of nutrients.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Mayo Clinic recommends whole grains as part of a healthy diet to prevent heart disease. Include whole grain bread, whole grain pasta, oatmeal, high fiber cereal, brown rice and other whole grain choices in your meals.</p>
<ol>
<li>Monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats include canola, olive and peanut oil. Choose these healthy fats when preparing food instead of the saturated fats in butter or salad dressing that can increase harmful cholesterol levels, according to WebMD. <h2 id="Basic-Activity"><a href="#Basic-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Basic Activity"></a>Basic Activity</h2></li>
